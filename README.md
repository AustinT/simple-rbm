# simple-rbm
A simple implementation of Restricted Boltzmann Machines. It is meant to provide an easy way to compare the different types of gradient descent used to train RBMs, such as stochastic gradient descent, full expected log-likelihood gradient, and contrastive divergence.

## Upgrades to be done
- Add persistent contrastive divergence
- Use additional optimizers such as Adam
